# Transformer Models In Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation

The purpose of this repository is to explore the application of the Vision Transformer in a variety
of semantic segmentaiton applications. Mainly, we want to explore a common method of convolutional unsupervised image
segmentation, and then both supervised and unsupervised methods of transformer based segmentations. All credit
goes to the original authors and we have done our best to cite all code and ideas borrowed from them. 

The three architecutures that we will explore are:
- [WNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08506.pdf) - A Fully Convolutional Method of Unsupervised Segmentation
- [Segmenter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05633.pdf) - Supervised Segmentation powered by Transformers
- [DINO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14294.pdf) -Unsupervised  Attention Segmentation via Contrastive Learning
